## Install

Run the following command in your studio folder using the Sanity CLI:

```sh
sanity install vercel-deploy
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** If your Studio is not using the `@sanity/dashboard` part, you'll need to manually install this as well:

```sh
sanity install @sanity/dashboard
```

<br />

## Your first Vercel Deployment
Once installed, you should see a new "Deploy" tool in your Sanity Studio navbar.

To create a new deployment, click the `Add Project` button. Next, you'll be prompted to add the following:

**`Title`**
> A name for your deployment. This can be whatever you want, to help you organize your deployments. Typically, this should be the environment you are deploying to, like `Production` or `Staging`

<br />

**`Vercel Project Name`**
> This is the actual Project Name listed in your Vercel account. Navigate to your Project Settings within Vercel to find your Project Name.

<br />

**`Vercel Team Slug`**
> If your project is part of a Vercel Team you will need to fill out this field. Navigate to your Team from within Vercel, and use the URL slug (ie. vercel.com/`team-666`).

<br />

**`Deploy Hook URL`**
> This is the Vercel Deploy hook you want to trigger. You can set these up within your Vercel Project, under Settings -> Git and scroll down to the "Deploy Hooks" section. Create your desired hook (ie. "Production Deploy" on `main` branch)

<br />

**`Vercel Token`**
> This is a token from your Vercel Account (not project). Navigate to your Account Settings, and go to "Tokens". Create a new Token, giving it a recognizable name for what it's being used for, like "Sanity Deploy". A Token will be generated for you to copy **once**.

üòé Once you've created your deployment you can now trigger deploys at anytime!
